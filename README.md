# JS
1. beancounting.js : takes a string as its argument and returns a number that indicates how many specified characters there are in the string.
takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted.

2. ChessBoard.js: creates a string that represents an n×n grid, using newline characters to separate lines. 
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.

3. FizzBuzz.js: uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. 
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

4. LoopingATriangle.js: Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

5. minimum.js: takes two arguments and returns their minimum

6. recursion.js: The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.

7. SumofARange.js: range function takes two arguments, start and end, and returns an array containing all the numbers from start up to (and including) end.
sum function takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of these numbers

8. ReversingAnArray.js: reverseArray, takes an array as argument and produces a new array that has the same elements in the inverse order. 
reverseArrayInPlace, does what the reverse method does: it modifies the array given as argument by reversing its elements. 
Neither may use the standard reverse method.

9. Flattening.js: Use the reduce method in combination with the concat method to “flatten” an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the original arrays.

10. OwnLoop.js: a higher-order function loop that provides something like a for loop statement. It takes a value, a test function, an update function, and a body function. Each iteration, it first runs the test function on the current loop value and stops if that returns false. Then it calls the body function, giving it the current value. Finally, it calls the update function to create a new value and starts from the beginning.

11. Everything.js: This one returns true when the given function returns true for every element in the array. 
Implement every as a function that takes an array and a predicate function as parameters. Write two versions, one using a loop and one using the some method.
