# JS
1. beancounting.js : takes a string as its argument and returns a number that indicates how many specified characters there are in the string.
takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted.

2. ChessBoard.js: creates a string that represents an n√ón grid, using newline characters to separate lines. 
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #

3. FizzBuzz.js: uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. 
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, 
and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).

4. LoopingATriangle.js: Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######

5. minimum.js: takes two arguments and returns their minimum

6. recursion.js: The function should accept a single parameter (a positive, whole number) and return a Boolean.
